collapse(ft, ...)

\method{collapse}{FeatureTable}(ft, ...)

collapse_features(ft, ...)

\method{collapse_features}{FeatureTable}(ft, ...)

collapse_samples(ft, ...)

\method{collapse_samples}{FeatureTable}(ft, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ft}{A FeatureTable. (Only used in the \code{S3} version.)}

\item{margin}{Margin to collapse.  E.g., \code{1} or \code{"samples"}
indicates rows, \code{2} or \code{"features"} indicates columns.}

\item{by}{The data column to collapse by.}

\item{keep_na}{Do you want to group all NAs together (TRUE) or drop them
(FALSE, the defult)?}

\item{keep_hierarchy}{Do you want to keep all data above the level specified
with the \code{by} argument? Pass \code{TRUE} to this parameter if you
know some of your data is hierarchical and you want to treat it as such.
See vignettes for details.}
}
\value{
A new FeatureTable with the specified margin collapsed on the
  specified metadata column.
}
\description{
Collapse samples/observations/rows or features/columns based on metadata. For
features/samples, any feature/sample with the same metadata for selected
category will be grouped.
}
\details{
Grouping is done by summing counts for each category.

If you to keep features/samples with \code{NA} for the \code{by} category,
pass \code{keep_na = TRUE}.  Then the NA will become a new factor in the
collapsed data.

Currently, you can only collapse on one metadata column at a time :(

\examples{
data(ft)

# You can direcctly access variables in the metadata.
ft$collapse("features", Color)
ft$collapse_features(Color)

# Or refer to them by strings.
ft$collapse("features", "Color")
ft$collapse_features("Color")

# You can collapse samples on metadata as well.
ft$collapse("samples", Location)
ft$collapse_samples(Location)

# And you can use the s3 style functions.
collapse(ft, "samples", Location)
collapse_samples(ft, Location)

collapse(ft, "features", Shape)
collapse_features(ft, Shape)

# For now, you can't do more than one variable at a time.  Sorry!

  ft$collapse_samples(c("Location", "Season"))
