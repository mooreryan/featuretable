- Add lots of docs and examples!
- Add another data set to use in examples (available with: `data(ft)`).

## featuretable v0.0.2

- Add some fancy stuff to the `keep` functions: `query` and `restrict`.  These
  are used to mix data and metadata queries into a single predicate, and to
  restrict data queries to subsets of samples.  Currently, they are only
  available in when keeping `features`.
- Add methods to collapse features based on metadata.
- Add various data utilities and helpers.

## featuretable v0.0.1

The first version!
