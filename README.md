# FeatureTable

## To do

- [ ] Test general bogus input...like `ft$keep("features", Arstoien == "green")`
- [ ] Accept `observations` as a valid margin.
- [ ] `*_with_data` functions to give apply functions direct access to data
- [ ] most function documentation is only in the s3 functions...add it to the R6
  methods as well

### Keep

- [ ] what if you pass optional arguments to a non-function predicate?
- [ ] move most of the exposition out of the `?keep` examples and into a
  vignette
