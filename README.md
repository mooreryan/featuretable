## Dependencies

- The only true runtime dependencies are `R6` and `rlang`.
- If you want nice plots, I suggest you also install `ggplot2` and `biplotr`.
- If you want fancy zero replacement, you should install `zCompositions`.
- If you need to import or export `phyloseq` objects, then you need to install `phyloseq`.
- If you want to run the test suite locally, then you need to install `testthat` and `vdiffr`.  If you want to run the coverage report for yourself, then you will need to install `covr`.
